    "text": "Out of the window a sea of green trees\nLift their soft boughs like the arms of a dancer,\nThey beckon and call me, \"Come out in the sun!\"\nBut I cannot answer.\n\nI am alone with Weakness and Pain,\nSick abed and June is going,\nI cannot keep her, she hurries by\nWith the silver-green of her garments blowing.\n\nMen and women pass in the street\nGlad of the shining sapphire weather,\nBut we know more of it than they,\nPain and I together.\n\nThey are the runners in the sun,\nBreathless and blinded by the race,\nBut we are watchers in the shade\nWho speak with Wonder face to face"

    "text": "Your jar of Virginny\nWill cost you a guinea,\nWhich you reckon too much by five shillings or ten;\nBut light your churchwarden\nAnd judge it according,\nWhen I've told you the troubles of poor honest men.\n\nFrom the Capes of the Delaware,\nAs you are well aware,\nWe sail which tobacco for England-but then,\nOur own British cruisers,\nThey watch us come through, sirs,\nAnd they press half a score of us poor honest men!\n\nOr if by quick sailing\n(Thick weather prevailing)\nWe leave them behind (as we do now and then)\nWe are sure of a gun from\nEach frigate we run from,\nWhich is often destruction to poor honest men!\n\nBroadsides the Atlantic\nWe tumble short-handed,\nWith shot-holes to plug and new canvas to bend;\nAnd off the Azores,\nDutch, Dons and Monsieurs\nAre waiting to terrify poor honest men.\n\nNapoleon's embargo\nIs laid on all cargo\nWhich comfort or aid to King George may intend;\nAnd since roll, twist and leaf,\nOf all comforts is chief,\nThey try for to steal it from poor honest men!\nWith no heart for fight,\nWe take refuge in flight,\nBut fire as we run, our retreat to defend;\nUntil our stern-chasers\nCut up her fore-braces,\nAnd she flies off the wind from us poor honest men!\n\n'Twix' the Forties and Fifties,\nSouth-eastward the drift is,\nAnd so, when we think we are making Land's End\nAlas, it is Ushant\nWith half the King's Navy\nBlockading French ports against poor honest men!\n\nBut they may not quit station\n(Which is our salvation)\nSo swiftly we stand to the Nor'ard again;\nAnd finding the tail of\nA homeward-bound convoy,\nWe slip past the Scillies like poor honest men.\n\n'Twix' the Lizard and Dover,\nWe hand our stuff over,\nThough I may not inform how we do it, nor when.\nBut a light on each quarter,\nLow down on the water,\nIs well understanded by poor honest men.\n\nEven then we have dangers,\nFrom meddlesome strangers,\nWho spy on our business and are not content\nTo take a smooth answer,\nExcept with a handspike...\nAnd they say they are murdered by poor honest men!\n\nTo be drowned or be shot\nIs our natural lot,\nWhy should we, moreover, be hanged in the end,\nAfter all our great pains\nFor to dangle in chains\nAs though we were smugglers, not poor honest men?"
